# Cosmos - Documentation

This documentation will give you information about everything there is to know about cosmos, and how to get it fully setup.

## What is Cosmos?

Cosmos, is a smart astronomy discord bot designed to give you the best information of what is happening in space. The discord bot simply fetches data from the APIs provided online. 

For example, if we want to see the APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day), we would fetch data from the latest APOD API. It is really simple way to do create a bot, although the lines of code to make this work is beyond insane.
