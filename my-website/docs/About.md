# Cosmos - Documentation

This documentation will give you information about everything there is to know about cosmos, and how to get it fully setup.

## What is Cosmos?

Cosmos, is a smart astronomy discord bot designed to give you the best information of what is happening in space. The discord bot simply fetches data from the APIs provided online. 

For example, if we want to see the APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day), we would fetch data from the latest APOD API. It is really simple way to do create a bot, although the lines of code to make this work is beyond insane.

## Only h2 and h3 will be in the TOC by default.

You can configure the TOC heading levels either per-document or in the theme configuration.

The headers are well-spaced so that the hierarchy is clear.

- lists will help you
- present the key points
- that you want your users to remember
  - and you may nest them
    - multiple times

## Custom ID headers {#custom-id}

With `{#custom-id}` syntax you can set your own header ID.
